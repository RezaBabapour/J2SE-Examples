# Excption handling in JAVA
There is two type of errors in compiled language. errors **before compile phase** and errors **after compile phase**.
the first category of errors are typically about the language syntax. compiler helps programmer to discover and resolve this type of errors.
Excption handling is the way to resolve the errors in **run time** or **after compile phase**.
## What is Runtime Error
Some errors that occurs after compile(interpret in java's term) phase. divide by zero is a simple example of this type, that programmer does not expect this happens in Runtime. there is some hope for handling the situation. like other languages programmer can surround suspicious code in try catch block.
